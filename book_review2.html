            "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life" by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles explores the concept of "Ikigai," which can be roughly translated as the reason for being. The authors share insights from the lives of Japanese centenarians who practice this philosophy and provide guidance on how readers can discover their own ikigai.
